Files for adding obscenities to iPhone® to stop autocorrect

## Easy Mode
Easy mode adds a contact to your device contacts with all the words in the name.
This will stop your phone from autocorrecting *fuck* to *duck*. It will
not make your phone suggest the words and will not let you autospell them with
swipe typing. For those you need to use Advanced Mode.

1. Download the [contact card](DuckMyPhone.vcf) and save to phone's contact app or save to another contact account that syncs with your phone.

## Advanced Mode
Advanced mode adds to your phone's dictionary. This will make your phone suggest the words if you misspell them and allow you to use the words when swipe typing. This requires setup on a Mac® with the same iCloud Drive® account as your phone and will also add the words to your computer's dictionary.

### Requirements

  1. Setup iCloud Drive on your iPhone and Mac
  1. Sign in to both devices with the same iCloud® account

If you do not have access to a Mac, or are unable to use iCloud or iCloud Drive you will need to use **Easy Mode** which has limited functionality.

### Download the dictionary

  * Download the [Duck My Phone Dictionary](DuckMyPhone.plist) on your computer

### Import text replacements

  1. On the Mac, open **System Preferences** (select Apple logo® in top corner > **System Preferences**), click **Keyboard**, click **Text** tab
  1. Drag *DuckMyPhone.plist* file from the downloaded location to the Text frame
  1. The dictionary will sync with your phone

You can add additional words on your own Text frame. To share your dictionary with others or for more details on importing and sharing text replacements, see the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl2a7bd795/mac" target="_blank">official help article</a>.

Note: this will also add these words to your computer's dictionary. If you change or remove the words on the computer it will also do the same on your phone.
